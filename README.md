# Pencil Durability Kata

This project seeks to mimic a normal graphite pencil. It writes on a piece of paper that holds all that was written on it before
and can also be edited after words have been erased. The pencil can write, erase words, be sharpened and it loses length as its sharpened,
becomes dull as it writes, and loses eraser life as it erases.
